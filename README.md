# Trip_Planer

Mobile application written in Java using Android Studio.

It was a project regarding my engineering thesis. 

The purpose of the application is to determine shortest route that enters all marked places. Basically TSP problem. 
Using google Maps user can mark places to visit and an algorithm will determine optimal(or at least good) route. 
Routes can be stored in the database(Firebase) and are available to the user at all times while connected to the internet.

Algoritms used are Brute force and Simulated anealing.

The app was implemented using MVVM pattern, also breif unit tests of view-model parts where done. 

Registration and login modules where implemented to enhance user expirence by personalizing data.

The app needs some work on the beauty side.
Some screens of an app:
